Welcome to "fast" pandas
========================

**fastpandas** is an odd collection of tips for using ``pandas`` and other related tools effectively. It is inspired by `R Inferno`_ and inherits some of its idiosyncrasies.

What this is not
----------------
If you're looking for a primer on the pandas DataFrame [1]_, `10 minutes to pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html>`_ is probably what you're looking for. For getting an understanding of Python as used by practitioners of "Data Science", `The Python Data Science Handbook <https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/>`_ might be a good place to begin. To understand the Python language itself, begin with `Fluent Python <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/>`_.
