Welcome to "fast" pandas
========================

**fastpandas** is an odd, opinionated collection of tips for using ``pandas`` and other related tools effectively. It is inspired by `R Inferno`_ and inherits some of its idiosyncrasies.

   All models are false but some are useful.

   -- George Box

The test of truth is simply that it works [#]_. As a consequence of this opinion, I have a bias for utility over technical rigour. Practically, this means that the content presented is a model of the truth as opposed to the truth itself. Terminology and concepts are presented in a way that I find useful, not necessarily technically accurate. That said, I welcome feedback on how the material can be improved.

What this is not
----------------
If you're looking for a primer on the pandas DataFrame [#]_, `10 minutes to pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html>`_ is probably what you're looking for. For getting an understanding of Python as used by practitioners of "Data Science", `The Python Data Science Handbook <https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/>`_ might be a good place to begin. To understand the Python language itself, begin with `Fluent Python <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/>`_.

.. [#] If on the other hand, you're wondering whether a "DataFrame" is a new kind of dinosaur, please close this tab immediately.
